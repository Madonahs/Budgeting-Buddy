# BudgetingBuddyDraft

So I have a general idea and I am working on it privately, this repository is my dummy and i am trying to use Kotlin to build the app.

Kotlin is a statically typed programming language that runs on the Java virtual machine and also can be compiled to JavaScript source code or use the LLVM compiler infrastructure.

## Budget Buddy

This will be a budgeting app.
